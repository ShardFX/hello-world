Tutorial

Greetings,

Hey ShardFX, Haikal here (Vsauce reference). 
I like C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python.
Currently, I only use C, C++, and Java extensively.
I hate pineapples on pizza, but I can accept a tiny amount of it.
Also, spicy is false advertising in the US. US Spicy = Asian mild.

Why are you reading this? This is just a tutorial for me.
